\title{Score a Model Fit}
\usage{
score_forecast(fit_samples, observations, scores = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{fit_samples}{A dataframe as produced by \code{EpiSoon::forecast}.}

\item{observations}{A dataframe of observations against which to score. Should contain a \code{date} and \code{rt} column.}

\item{scores}{Character vector defaulting to "all". Select which scores to return, default is all scores but
any subset can be returned.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the following scores per forecast timepoint: dss, crps,
logs, bias, and sharpness as well as the forecast date and time horizon.
}
\description{
Score a Model Fit
}
\examples{

## Fit a model (using a subset of observations)
samples <- forecast_rt(EpiSoon::example_obs_rts[1:10, ],
                     model = function(...) {EpiSoon::bsts_model(model =
                    function(ss, y){bsts::AddSemilocalLinearTrend(ss, y = y)}, ...)},
                     horizon = 7, samples = 10)

## Score the model fit (with observations during the time horizon of the forecast)
score_forecast(samples, EpiSoon::example_obs_rts)

## Return just CRPS, bias and sharpness
score_forecast(samples, EpiSoon::example_obs_rts, scores = c("crps", "sharpness", "bias"))

## Return just the CRPS
score_forecast(samples, EpiSoon::example_obs_rts, scores = "crps")
}
