\arguments{
\item{y}{Numeric vector of time points to forecast}

generate the weights for the mixture model}

time horizon and rows representing samples).

\description{
Provides a wrapper for different EpiSoon models and generates
a mixture model of these models based on the (Continuous) Rank Probability
Score

A list of models is supplied. These models are fit to the data up until a
period of observations of size \code{weighting_period}. Forecasts are generated
from all the models for all time points in the \code{weighting_period}.
Predictive samples generated by the individual models are then used to
create model weights in an ensemble based on CRPS. All models are then
refitted for the entire timeseries and predictions are generated from these
models. Draws from the individual model predictive samples are then used
to generate a mixture model with the weights obtained in the previous step.

The weights are computed using \code{\link[stackr]{stack_crps}} from
the package \code{stackr} to minimise CRPS. The function
\code{\link[stackr]{mixture_from_sample}} from the same package is used
to draw samples from the
individual models to form the mixture models.
